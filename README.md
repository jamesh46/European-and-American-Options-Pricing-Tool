# üìà Monte Carlo Options Pricing Tool

This **Option Pricing Tool** provides a user-friendly interface to calculate the fair price of financial options using various pricing models for both European and American Options. It is designed to be used for personal financial research as a tool for quick option valuation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Black-Scholes Model** ‚Äì Best suited for European-style options.
- **Binomial Tree Model** ‚Äì Supports American-style options and early exercise.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations** ‚Äì Estimates prices for more complex or path-dependent options using the Longstaff-Schwartz method.

The tool will guide the user to use the appropriate model for the type of option.


## üìä Usage

### Option Inputs
- **Stock Ticker**: Enter the stock's symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
- **Expiration Date**: The date when the option expires.
- **Strike Price**: The agreed price at which the option can be exercised.
- **Option Type**: Choose between Call or Put options.
- **Option Style**: Select either American or European style options.

### Searching and Comparing Market Options
- The tool allows users to **search for live options data** from the options market. Users can retrieve real-time options for a particular stock and see various contracts available for different expiration dates and strike prices.
- Once an option is selected from the available contracts, the user can input it into the tool to compare its **bid/ask prices**, **implied volatility**, and **model-generated fair value**.
  
For example, if you want to compare a call option with a strike price of $150 and an expiration of December 31, 2024:
1. Search for the available options for **AAPL**.
2. Select the desired contract (strike price, expiration, etc.).
3. Enter the contract details into the tool, which will retrieve the real-time market data and provide the model's pricing output for comparison.

### Pricing Methods
- **Black-Scholes**: Suitable for European options only.
- **Binomial Tree**: Ideal for American-style options due to early exercise capabilities.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Can handle complex or path-dependent options, particularly useful for American options with more intricate payoff structures.

### Example Output
- The tool will return values such as the **option's fair price**, **implied volatility**, and **bid/ask prices** from the models.
- This in the event that the model determines the fair price to be lower than the ... price, in the theory, the user might consider purchasing this option.

### WARNINGS
- Please remember that this model is rudimentary relative to those used in industry and developed as a research project. Any Recommendations are to guide potential research only and should not be taken as financial advice.

### Key Financial Assumptions:
- **Implied Volatility**: Automatically fetched based on market data.
- **Risk-Free Rate**: Assumed to be 1% by default, but can be modified within the code if required.
- **Dividend Yield**: Assumed to be 0, unless specified otherwise.

### Example Pricing Scenario
```plaintext
Stock: AAPL
Option Type: Call, American
Strike Price: $150
Expiration: 2024-12-31

- Fair Value (Monte Carlo - Longstaff-Schwartz): $12.50
- Implied Volatility: 23.5%
- Bid: $12.30 | Ask: $12.70
